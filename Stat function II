#Percent_change
#Series, DatFrames and Panel, all have the function pct_change(). This function compares every element with its prior element and computes the change percentage

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

s= pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5,4])
print(s.pct_change())

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(5,2))
print(df.pct_change())



#By default, the pct_change() operates on columns; if you want to apply the same row wise, then use axis=1() argument.
#____________________________________
#Covariance
#Covariance is applied on series data. The Series object has a method cov to compute covariance between series objects. NA will be excluded automatically

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

s1= pd.Series(np.random.randn(10))
s2 = pd.Series(np.random.randn(10))
print(s1.cov(s2))
