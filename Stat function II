#Percent_change
#Series, DatFrames and Panel, all have the function pct_change(). This function compares every element with its prior element and computes the change percentage

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

s= pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5,4])
print(s.pct_change())

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(5,2))
print(df.pct_change())
